# Files collected from or created for St. John's

A collection of various files related to St. John's classes, reading groups,
or just general education in that vein.

## Admin Documents

`admin-docs` will contain miscellaneous useful files that aren't for one
specific course. For example, the Eastern Classics Reading list created in TeX:
[admin-docs/MAEC-Reading-List-2024-2025.pdf](admin-docs/MAEC-Reading-List-2024-2025.pdf)
and it's [source TeX file](admin-docs/MAEC-Reading-List.tex)

## Sanskrit

### Devanagari Transliteration Schemes and Typing Characters

There are a few transliteration schemes for Sanskrit, see
[Wikipedia's Comparison Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari_transliteration#Transliteration_comparison).

Your textbook will likely teach IAST. This is easy to remember & write but hard
to type, e.g. when search for words online in the [Monier-Williams dictionary](https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/2020/web/webtc1/index.php).
That websites use SLP1 - where every Devanagari character is written in a
single roman alphabet letter - for example:
ड (ḍ in IAST) is typed as 'q',
and ढ (ḍh in IAST) is typed as 'Q'

TODO: add links or words about enabling other keyboards
(on... pc mac linux ios android?), and keyboard map for less common characters.

### Sanskrit Dictionaries online or loaded into phone apps

Monier-Williams and other dictionaries are available online at the
[Cologne Digital Sanskrit Dictionaries Site](https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/).
But this can be a bit clunky on a phone.

I found a number of dictionaries available at
[indic-dict/stardict-sanskrit](https://github.com/indic-dict/stardict-sanskrit),
but I found the instructions a bit confusing.

I will do a better write-up soon hopefully, but in the meantime, go to:
[indic-dict/stardict-sanskrit's index of dictionary files](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/indic-dict/stardict-sanskrit/gh-pages/sa-head/en-entries/tars/tars.MD)
(which was copied from : [indic-dict/stardict-index's larger index of indexes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/indic-dict/stardict-index/master/dictionaryIndices.md))
and download the [Monier-Williams compressed file](https://github.com/indic-dict/stardict-sanskrit/raw/gh-pages/sa-head/en-entries/tars/mw-cologne__2024-01-17_03-14-56Z__14MB.tar.gz)
and the [Whitney's Roots compressed file](https://github.com/indic-dict/stardict-sanskrit/raw/gh-pages/sa-head/en-entries/tars/whitney-roots__2024-07-31_07-04-20Z__0MB.tar.gz)
then get a phone dictionary app that can load in StarDict files
(DictionaryUniversal (?) on iPhone is what I use and is worth the $5,
or Dicty works decently well for free)

### Sanskrit Grammar Reference Tables

I originally copied the tables from the book, or retyped them myself, but after
a while I wanted a more complete reference sheet.

I found the [Sanskrit Garden of Paradigms](https://www.yesvedanta.com/sanskrit/garden/)
to be incredibly useful. Also look at the
[Fancy Sanskrit Grammar Tables](https://www.yesvedanta.com/sanskrit/tenses/)
to remind you of more details. The two tables reference each other.

### Nāgārjuna Chapter 25 packet

In class we used a photocopy of Chapter 25 of Nāgārjuna's Mūlamadhyamakakārikā.

My hope is to have at least some chapters of Nāgārjuna formatted in the
[Scharf/Rāmopākhyāna](https://bookshop.org/p/books/ramopakhyana-the-story-of-rama-in-the-mahabharata-a-sanskrit-independent-study-reader-peter-scharf/10187068)
style. But that hasn't happened yet.

In the meantime a PDF of the scanned packet we used in class is available here:
[nagarjuna-ch25.pdf](sanskrit/nagarjuna-ch25.pdf)

### Scharf's Rāmopākhyāna

For use with the
[Scharf/Rāmopākhyāna](https://bookshop.org/p/books/ramopakhyana-the-story-of-rama-in-the-mahabharata-a-sanskrit-independent-study-reader-peter-scharf/10187068),
I have taken most of the tables from the Introduction and put them in a one
page spreadsheet to print out as a quick reference guide.
It is currently in an Excel file in OneDrive, but I can't create a publicly
viewable link for more than 60 days, so please contact me if you want to make
edits. Eventually I will probably save it directly here or reformat it in TeX,
or some more reasonable format.

A PDF of the quick reference guide I compiled from the Introduction of the
[Scharf's Rāmopākhyāna](https://bookshop.org/p/books/ramopakhyana-the-story-of-rama-in-the-mahabharata-a-sanskrit-independent-study-reader-peter-scharf/10187068),
can be found here:

## Kumulipo Reading Group

I am facilitating a reading group on the Kumulipo and have the source text here,
which I am working to further interlinearize.

## Chinese Poetry

Go to this [interactive Jupyter Notebook, created/hosted through Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/julowe/st-johns/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2Fchinese-poetry%2Fchinese_trots.ipynb) to easily create a crib/trot of a chinese poem. Instructions for usage in the notebook itself, it may take a minute for the server to fully load.
