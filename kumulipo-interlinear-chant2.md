With Hikawainui, and Hikawaina
Line 0265: O pulehulehu hako‘ako‘a  
Innumerable the coral ridges  
Amongst piles of heated coral
Line 0266: Ka mene ‘a‘ahu wa‘awa‘a  
Low, heaped-up, jagged  
That were thrown in piles unevenly,
Line 0267: O holi ka poki‘i i ke au ia uliuli  
The little ones seek the dark places  
So thin and scraggy in the blue tide.
Line 0268: Po‘ele wale ka moana powehiwehi  
Very dark is the ocean and obscure  
Surely it must be dismal, that unknown deep;
Line 0269: He kai ko‘ako‘a no ka uli o Paliuli  
A sea of coral like the green heights of Paliuli  
’Tis a sea of coral from the depth of Paliuli,
Line 0270: O he‘e wale ka ‘aina ia lakou  
The land disappears into them  
And when the land recedes from them
Line 0271: O kaha uliuli wale i ka po--la  
Covered by the darkness of night  
The east is still in darkness of night,
Line 0272: Po--no  
Still it is night  
        ’Tis night.
