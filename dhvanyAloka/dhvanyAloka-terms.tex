\section{Introduction}

One of the principal achievements of Indian aesthetics (\textit{alaṅkāra}) is its analysis of the nature of the poetic experience.
According to its two foremost theorists, poetry consists in the power of suggestion (\textit{dhvani}), and, conversely, produces in the audience an experience of relishing (\textit{rasa}) that is not emotional but transcendental (\textit{alaukika}).
The crucial texts of these theorists, however, do not lend themselves to a straightforward study.
Anandavardhana wrote verses (\textit{kārikā}), upon which he composed a commentary (\textit{vṛtti}), the \textit{Dhvanyāloka}.
Abhinavagupta subsequently composed a commentary on both the verses and commentary of Ānandavardhana, called the \textit{Locana}.
Given the length, complexity, and seeming randomness of topics taken up in these works, a simplifying approach seems in order.
To provide a roadmap, as it were, of the rasa-theory, a chapter from A. B. Keith's \textit{The Sanskrit Drama}, ``The Sentiments'', is first provided.
Select passages from Ānandavardhana and Abhinavagupta, from the excellent translation of Ingalls, Masson, and Patwardhan, are then presented; these selections contain the most direct, if not exhaustive, formulations or discussions of \textit{dhvani} and \textit{rasa}.

Please note that the scholarly footnotes to the selections are supplied for completeness' sake only: they are not crucial to understanding the texts.
The complete translation will be on reserve in the library.
