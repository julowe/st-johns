% \maketitle

% \section{Introduction}

% One of the principal achievements of Indian aesthetics (\textit{alaṅkāra}) is its analysis of the nature of the poetic experience.
% According to its two foremost theorists, poetry consists in the power of suggestion (\textit{dhvani}), and, conversely, produces in the audience an experience of relishing (\textit{rasa}) that is not emotional but transcendental (\textit{alaukika}).
% The crucial texts of these theorists, however, do not lend themselves to a straightforward study.
% Ānandavardhana wrote verses (\textit{kārikā}), upon which he composed a commentary (\textit{vṛtti}), the \textit{Dhvanyāloka}.
% Abhinavagupta subsequently composed a commentary on both the verses and commentary of Ānandavardhana, called the \textit{Locana}.
% Given the length, complexity, and seeming randomness of topics taken up in these works, a simplifying approach seems in order.
% To provide a roadmap, as it were, of the rasa-theory, a chapter from A. B. Keith's \textit{The Sanskrit Drama}, ``The Sentiments'', is first provided.
% Select passages from Ānandavardhana and Abhinavagupta, from the excellent translation of Ingalls, Masson, and Patwardhan, are then presented; these selections contain the most direct, if not exhaustive, formulations or discussions of \textit{dhvani} and \textit{rasa}.

% Please note that the scholarly footnotes to the selections are supplied for completeness' sake only: they are not crucial to understanding the texts.
% The complete translation will be on reserve in the library.

Words in ``quotes'' are from IMP translation, unless otherwise noted.
Notation follows IMP sections, pages given when translation of K. Kris.\ is used.
Footnotes are marked by a dot, e.g. ``1.1 L.1'' is footnote 1 for the Locana of 1.1.
``(M.W. p.\#)'' refers to a page from Monier-Williams Sanskrit -- English Dictionary, 1899 printing.
I have attempted to provide the reference from where each term is first encountered.
