\section{Introduction}

 {\fontsize{12pt}{14pt}\selectfont
  One of the principal achievements of Indian aesthetics (\textit{alaṅkāra}) is its analysis of the nature of the poetic experience.
  According to its two foremost theorists, poetry consists in the power of suggestion (\textit{dhvani}), and, conversely, produces in the audience an experience of relishing (\textit{rasa}) that is not emotional but transcendental (\textit{alaukika}).
  The crucial texts of these theorists, however, do not lend themselves to a straightforward study.
  Ānandavardhana wrote verses (\textit{kārikā}), upon which he composed a commentary (\textit{vṛtti}), the \textit{Dhvanyāloka}.
  Abhinavagupta subsequently composed a commentary on both the verses and commentary of Ānandavardhana, called the \textit{Locana}.
  Given the length, complexity, and seeming randomness of topics taken up in these works, a simplifying approach seems in order.
  To provide a roadmap, as it were, of the rasa-theory, a chapter from A. B. Keith's \textit{The Sanskrit Drama}, ``The Sentiments'', is first provided.
  Select passages from Ānandavardhana and Abhinavagupta, from the excellent translation of Ingalls, Masson, and Patwardhan, are then presented; these selections contain the most direct, if not exhaustive, formulations or discussions of \textit{dhvani} and \textit{rasa}.

  Please note that the scholarly footnotes to the selections are supplied for completeness' sake only: they are not crucial to understanding the texts.
  The complete translation will be on reserve in the library.

\section{Expanded List of Terms}

Translation of Sanskrit terms in ``quotes'' are from IMP translation, unless otherwise noted.
I have attempted to provide the reference from where each term is first encountered.
Notation follows section numbering in IMP translation. Page numbers are given when translation of K. Kris.\ is used.
% TODO: spell out K. Kris.
Alternate translations are separated by a comma (whether from a subsequent section of IMP text, or from K. Kris.).
Significantly differing definitions or usages are separated by a semicolon.
Footnotes are marked by a dot, e.g. ``1.1 L.1'' is footnote 1 for the Locana of 1.1.
``(M.W. p.\#)'' refers to a page from Monier-Williams Sanskrit---English Dictionary, 1899 printing.
